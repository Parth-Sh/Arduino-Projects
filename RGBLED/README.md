# RGB LED Project

This project uses an RGB LED with the Arduino Uno R3 (from the Elegoo Starter Kit) to display different colors by combining red, green, and blue light.

# What It Does

The Arduino cycles through three different color combinations every 0.5 seconds by turning specific LED pins on or off.

### Color Sequence:
1.Yellow – Red + Green (Blue OFF)
2.Magenta – Red + Blue (Green OFF)
3.Cyan / Bluish – Green + Blue (Red OFF)

##Components Used

- Arduino Uno R3
- Common Cathode RGB LED
- 3 × 220O Resistors
- Breadboard
- 4 Jumper wires
